title: Teams API
description: >
  The teams API allows for the creation and management of teams. Teams are simple lists of Users.
  teams are conceptually very similar to the SCIM groups provided by SSO2, except that they have a different access control model.
  The access control model for Teams is described in 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/apigee.com/document/d/1PCniPha6wmPwAkJbA6Bn1dH6a7QTsHZ4xsSFBvAXS3A/edit?usp=sharing">this document</a>.
  This access control model allows Teams to be created without special permissions.
  The API for Permissions is <a href="permissions.html">here</a>.
