title: Users API
description: >
  The Users API is a Rapier proxy for the SSO2 API. The entities it describes are User and Group.
  We may never implement the Users APIâ€”we may simply program to the SSO2 (SCIM) interface. In that case,
  we may change the Rapier files to treat URLs of users as simple URLs, not relationships.
